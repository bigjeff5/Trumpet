The goal is to be able to read in sheet music and/or MIDI music and play along with trumpet fingerings included.

Heavily inspired by the Brassified YouTube channel, I wanted a play along system that I could customise to my liking.

Initially planning to use PyGame to get the visuals going. We'll see where this goes.
